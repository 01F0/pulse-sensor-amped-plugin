This is a plugin for [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) that listens to data from [Pulse Sensor Amped](http://pulsesensor.com/) using the serial data provided from the [Arduino example](https://github.com/WorldFamousElectronics/PulseSensor_Amped_Arduino).
The pulse sensor data is displayed as a component in OBS Studio. As for now, only the heart rate BPM is shown.

Here's what it looks like: ![](https://youtu.be/iX_Zih2sVhY:

## Build instructions
Assuming that you have the obs-studio environment upo and running. Also, the **text_ft2_source** plugin needs to be included in the environment, since it is used as a sub-source.

1. Create a new folder in the obs-studio/plugin folder, called **win-pulse-sensor-amped**
2. Put all source files from this repo in the new folder
3. Add the following line in the bottom of **obs-studio/plugin/CMakeLists.txt**: *add_subdirectory(win-pulse-sensor-amped)*
4. Configure/generate the obs-studio CMake project. 

The plugin should now be included as a project in the Visual Studio solution generated by CMake.

## Further development/limitations
* Make more use of the data received from the Arduino, right now, we only use the heart rate.

* The serial readouts is done using the Windows API, perhaps something should be added for other operating systems.
